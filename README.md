# CS 101 - Introduction to Computer Science

Welcome to my CS 101 repository! This collection contains all my coursework, labs, projects, and in-class exercises from the CS 101 course.

## 📚 Course Overview
**Primary Language:** C++

This repository documents my journey through the fundamentals of computer science, covering topics such as:
- Basic C++ Syntax and Logic
- Control Structures (Loops, Conditionals)
- Data Structures (Arrays, Vectors)
- Memory Management (Pointers, Smart Pointers, Dynamic Allocation)
- File I/O Operations
- Algorithms (Binary Search, Sorting, Recursion)

## 📂 Repository Structure

### [Labs](./Labs)
Hands-on laboratory assignments focused on specific concepts.
- **Lab 01:** Basic logic, binary representation, and string manipulation.
- **Lab 02:** File I/O and data processing (e.g., grade reporting).
- **Lab 03:** Type casting and data types.
- **Lab 05:** Dynamic memory and string handling.
- **Lab 08:** Object-oriented programming concepts (Contacts).

### [Projects](./Projects)
Larger assignments demonstrating the application of cumulative knowledge.
- **Project 01 - 04:** Comprehensive applications involving more complex logic and data handling.

### [inClass](./inClass)
Code snippets and exercises written during lectures.
- Examples include: `fibonacci.cpp`, `vectors.cpp`, `smartpointers.cpp`, and basic file input/output demonstrations.

## 🚀 How to Run
To compile and run any of the `.cpp` files, use a C++ compiler like `g++`.

**Example:**
```bash
# Compile
g++ -o program_name source_file.cpp

# Run
./program_name
```
